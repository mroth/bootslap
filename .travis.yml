# The os: directive should work to set the proper operating system, but it
# appears this is a beta feature only on some accounts?
#
# To get around that for now, we tell a little white lie about what language
# we are using, which forces travis-ci to use a OSX box.
os: osx
language: objective-c

# Travis CI does a lot to get their OSX image all nice and ready to go.
#
# That's great, but not so great for testing our own bootstrapping script.
#
# So let's do a few things to *undo* that, in order to make sure our script will
# work on a semi virgin setup.

  # uninstall homebrew

  # TODO: it would be great if we could uninstall the XCode Dev Tools and CLI
  # dev tools to ensure at least the CLI version gets reinstalled, but I think
  # that the automated ways to install it still require the user to click a
  # button on a popup, so might not work here.  Figure this out.

# Use environment vars to override default bootslap repo location, otherwise
# bootslap.sh is going to guess based on a username of "travis."
#
# We could also change that username for travis but let's not, that way we can
# make sure our scripts don't rely on hard coded usernames anywhere.)
